# public-api-request

### using html, css, and javascript to get request from public api

### the goal is seeing random city's weather of Turkey's cities.

### Contents:
##### html
##### css
##### javascript

first of all, we have to sing up in openweathermap.org, there are tons of simple api's and ton's of data so after signing up they will give api key which is unique id so do not use mine it will not work.
they are gonna provide you a url and {&q=} add{your city name}{&appid=......}
then start coding...
create index.html, style.css, and index.js files
and requesting jquery, we used it to request data.
everything is inside weather-container div class, inside index.js file we use getJSON with help of jquery, in getJSON url, and function parameter is data, and then  icon, temp, city name etc are defined here and added icon inside image (<img> html tag ) and temp inside paragraf etc
